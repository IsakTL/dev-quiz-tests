This project is meant as an exercise in testing via Cypress.

## Instructions
Download the repo and change the .env.EXAMPLE file to a regular .env with your Mongo database. Run install, build, and seed via npm, then run test or open Cypress to view tests in progress.

## Usage
Since this is intended as a demonstration of the use of Cypress in full-stack development, running the tests is the main purpose of the app unless you want to brush up on your Python knowledge.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute, frankly I'd be very surprised but delighted. Fork the repo, or make changes and email me to contribute.

## Tests
Component testing: Tests the initial load of the page. E2e testing: tests that the app runs as expected by clicking on options.
